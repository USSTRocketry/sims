# To create each picture, the algorythm performs the following actions:

# - Fits a normal distribution to the dataset and compute the average value and standard deviation;
# - Prints the fitted mean and standard deviation,
# - Creates a histogram of the data and overlays the corresponding normal distribution curve;
# - Adds title, axis labels, and a grid to the plot for better clarity;
# - Saves the plot as a .svg file for high-quality output (e.g., for reports or web use);
# - Saves the entire figure as a pickle file for later reuse or resizing;

# An additional step may be included to prevent automatic sequential display while running the simulation:

# - Closes the figure to prevent automatic sequential display. This would be an obstacle for analysts trying to visualize more plots at once, after they have all been generated
